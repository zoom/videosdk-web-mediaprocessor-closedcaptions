# Video SDK Web Media Processor - Closed Captions

Use of this sample app is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://explore.zoom.us/en/video-sdk-terms/).

The [Zoom Video SDK for web](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/web/) enables you to build custom video experiences on a webpage with Zoom's core technology. This demo showcases how to use a [media processor](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/web/raw-data) to display closed captions on user video and screenshare. It uses the Video SDK [Live transcription](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/web/transcription-translation/) feature.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/zoom/videosdk-web-mediaprocessor-closedcaptions`

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

   `bun install # or npm install`

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, you can do this by copying the `.env.example` file (`cp .env.example .env`) and replacing the values with your own. The `.env` file should look like this, with your own Zoom Video SDK key and secret:

   ```
   VITE_SDK_KEY=abc123XXXXXXXXXX
   VITE_SDK_SECRET=abc123XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

   Add your Zoom Video SDK key and secret to the `.env` file.

1. Run the app:

   `npm run dev`

## Usage

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173

1. Click "Join" to join the session

1. As you speak, you'll see closed captions displayed on your video and screenshare.

For the full list of features and event listeners, as well as additional guides, see our [Video SDK docs](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/web/).

## Disclaimer

Do not expose your credentials to the client, when using the Video SDK in production please make sure to use a backend service to sign the tokens. Don't store credentials in plain text, as this is a sample app we're using an `.env` for sake of simplicity.
